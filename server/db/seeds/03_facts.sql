Neither side stood behind their commitments, and the charter was annulled by Pope Innocent III, leading to the First Barons War.', 'After Johns death, the regency government of his young son, Henry III, reissued the document in 1216, stripped of some of its more radical content, in an unsuccessful bid to build political support for their cause. At the end of the war in 1217, it formed part of the peace treaty agreed at Lambeth, where the document acquired the name Magna Carta, to distinguish it from the smaller Charter of the Forest which was issued at the same time. Short of funds, Henry reissued the charter again in 1225 in exchange for a grant of new taxes. His son, Edward I, repeated the exercise in 1297, this time confirming it as part of Englands statute law. The charter became part of English political life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling Parliament of England passed new laws, it lost some of its practical significance.', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tycBBN2f2j0','https://www.tmc.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/06/tmc_pulse_5_24_press-34.jpg','https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sl6XozqfQKE/hqdefault.jpg','King John, Cardinal Stephen Langton');

Flemings student Cecil George Paine was the first to successfully use penicillin to treat eye infection (ophthalmia neonatorum) in 1930.

It was coined by Alexander Fleming on 7 March 1929 when he discovered the antibacterial property of Penicillium rubens. Fleming explained in his 1929 paper in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology that "to avoid the repetition of the rather cumbersome phrase "Mould broth filtrate", the name "penicillin" will be used."

The steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. This pushing force can be transformed, by a connecting rod and crank, into rotational force for work.','The first recorded rudimentary steam-powered "engine" was the aeolipile described by Hero of Alexandria, a Greek mathematician and engineer in Roman Egypt in the first century AD. In the following centuries, the few steam-powered "engines" known were, like the aeolipile, essentially experimental devices used by inventors to demonstrate the properties of steam. A rudimentary steam turbine device was described by Taqi al-Din in Ottoman Egypt in 1551 and by Giovanni Branca in Italy in 1629. The Spanish inventor Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont received patents in 1606 for 50 steam-powered inventions, including a water pump for draining inundated mines. Denis Papin, a Huguenot, did some useful work on the steam digester in 1679, and first used a piston to raise weights in 1690.','The first commercial steam-powered device was a water pump, developed in 1698 by Thomas Savery.[11] It used condensing steam to create a vacuum which raised water from below and then used steam pressure to raise it higher. Small engines were effective though larger models were problematic. They had a very limited lift height and were prone to boiler explosions. Saverys engine was used in mines, pumping stations and supplying water to water wheels powering textile machinery. Saverys engine was of low cost. Bento de Moura Portugal introduced an improvement of Saverys construction "to render it capable of working itself", as described by John Smeaton in the Philosophical Transactions published in 1751. It continued to be manufactured until the late 18th century. At least one engine was still known to be operating in 1820.','https://www.youtube.com/embed/9mhYnQGZJuM', 'https://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/og-large-steam-engine.png','http://www.up.com/cs/groups/public/@uprr/@customers/documents/image/img_tr_1868_up119.jpg','Thomas Newcomen, James Watt');

She set many other records, was one of the first aviators to promote commercial air travel','Born and raised in Atchison, Kansas, and later in Des Moines, Iowa, Earhart developed a passion for adventure at a young age, steadily gaining flying experience from her twenties. In 1928, Earhart became the first female passenger to cross the Atlantic by airplane (accompanying pilot Wilmer Stultz), for which she achieved celebrity status. In 1932, piloting a Lockheed Vega 5B, Earhart made a nonstop solo transatlantic flight, becoming the first woman to achieve such a feat. She received the United States Distinguished Flying Cross for this accomplishment.','In 1935, Earhart became a visiting faculty member at Purdue University as an advisor to aeronautical engineering and a career counselor to female students. She was also a member of the National Womans Party and an early supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment. Known as one of the most inspirational American figures in aviation from the late 1920s throughout the 1930s, Earharts legacy is often compared to the early aeronautical career of pioneer aviator Charles Lindbergh, as well as to figures like First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt for their close friendship and lasting impact on the issue of womens causes from that period.','https://www.youtube.com/embed/ivbh9vEkp1g','https://www.timeforkids.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AG_amelia.jpg','https://flyingmag.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com/flyingma/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/25160753/shutterstock_238057645-1-1568x1046.jpg', 'Amelia Earhart');

Board of Education (1954), Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States (1964), and Loving v.
